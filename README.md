# inx-nodered-modbus-demonstrator
This project demonstrates how to use nodered to communicate with an EHS device using modbus.
Install the default raspberry pi image
Then open a terminal and run this command
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbeaumontinx/inx-nodered-modbus-demonstrator/main/raspberry-setup.sh)
This should download and install node-red along with the modbus-serial node package.
